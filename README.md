Installation Guide
------------------

### 1\. Clone or Download the Repository

*   git clone https://github.com/Hanzalahc/Book-Store-using-Mern-Stack-and-RTK-React-19.git
*   Alternatively, you can download the repository as a ZIP file and extract it.
    

### 2\. Project Structure

The repository contains two main directories:

*   **Client**: The front-end React application.
    
*   **Server**: The back-end Node.js application.
    

### 3\. Environment Setup

You need to create .env files for both the **client** and **server** projects. Follow these steps:

#### **Client (Front-End)**:

1.  Navigate to the client directory.
    
2.  Create a .env file.
    
3.  Add the Firebase configuration provided by Google Firebase. Once you create a Firebase project, you will receive the necessary credentials to paste here.
4.  Add the following variables to the .env file:
   VITE_FIREBASE_API_KEY=
   VITE_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=
   VITE_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=
   VITE_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=
   VITE_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=
   VITE_FIREBASE_APP_ID=
    
#### **Server (Back-End)**:

1.  Navigate to the server directory.
    
2.  Create a .env file.
    
3.  Add the following variables to the .env file:
    
    PORT=8000
    MONGODB_URI=
    CORS_ORIGIN=
    JWT_SECRET=
    JWT_ACCESS_EXPIRY=1d
    JWT_REFRESH_EXPIRY=7d
    JWT_PASS_EXPIRY=5m
    NODE_ENV=development
    NODE_SS=lax

    CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME=
    CLOUDINARY_API_KEY=
    CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET=
    CLOUDINARY_FOLDER=

### 4\. Install Dependencies

Open two terminal windows and navigate into the client and server directories respectively. Then, run the following commands:

#### For the Client:

  `npm install`  

#### For the Server:

` npm install ` 

If you donâ€™t have npm installed, download and install the **Node.js LTS version** first.

### 5\. Running the Application

Once dependencies are installed, use the following commands to start the project in development mode:

#### For the Client:

`   npm run dev   `

#### For the Server:

`   npm run dev   `
    
*   Visit the client URL to interact with the Bookstore application.
